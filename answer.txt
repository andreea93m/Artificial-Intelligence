First of all, we establish our knowledge base from the statements in the riddle. The used literals are

* IsMagical
* GoesSailingOnRainbows
* CanPlantRainbowSeeds
* IsMythical

* IsHorned

Now we write our knowledge base with these literals.

IsMagical OR GoesSailingOnRainbows IMPLIES CanPlantRainbowSeeds

(1) NOT IsMagical OR CanPlantRainbowSeeds
(2) NOT GoesSailingOnRainbows OR CanPlantRainbowSeeds

If the unicorn is mythical, then it is immortal and goes sailing on rainbows.
IsMythical IMPLIES IsImmortal AND GoesSailingOnRainbows

(3) NOT IsMythical OR IsImmortal

If it is not mythical, then it is just a mortal mammal.
NOT IsMythical IMPLIES NOT IsImmortal

(5) IsMythical OR NOT IsImmortal

If the unicorn is either immortal or a mammal, then it is horned.
IsImmortal EXCLUSIVE OR NOT IsImmortal IMPLIES IsHorned

(6) IsHorned

The unicorn is magical if it is horned.
IsHorned IMPLIES IsMagical

(7) NOT IsHorned OR IsMagical

The queried statements are proven or shown not to be inferable using resolution.

2 (A)

This statement is not inferable. The only possibility to prove it is to eliminate NOT IsMythical in (4). Furthermore, to show IsMythical we need to eliminate NOT IsImmortal in (5). However, IsImmortal can only be proven by eliminating NOT IsMythical again in (3).

2 (B)

(6), (7) infers
(8) IsMagical

(1), (8) infers
(9) CanPlantRainbowSeeds
