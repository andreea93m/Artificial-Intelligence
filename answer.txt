1.2 (A)

For our problem, there is exactly one goal, evaporating the cloud. For each path that reaches this goal, the calculated reward is
γ^n * R
where γ is the discount facter, n is the number of steps to reach the goal, and R is the immediate reward when achieving the goal. Since there is no other goal, the discount factor only influences the calculated reward value for each path, but the order of the values (i.e. which path is favorable) is indifferent to the discount factor.

1.2 (B)

The discount factor gives an estimate for the reward loss if the reward is far away in the future. If the discount factor is sufficiently low (i.e. close to zero), a low reward in the near future appears favorable over a high reward in the far future.

An example can be constructed by adapting the cloud evaporator goal: More than one clouds may be present on the board, but the game ends immediately after evaporating any cloud on the board. The reward is proportional to the number of evaporated clouds. Hence, the reward is higher if the player manages to evaporate several clounds at once.

Consider this board:

############
#p.........#
#c#.....#cc#
############

The player has two options: evaporating the closer cloud on the left at once (low, near future reward), or evaporating the two clouds on the right after moving across the board (high, far future reward). The favored option depends on the discount factor.
